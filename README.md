# Tracking the frequency of phytoplankton clonal lineages using multispectral image flow cytometry and neural networks
## Github page     Tracking-clonal-lineages-using-AI-

Code and data for the neural network on feature values of Imagestream MK II on phytoplankton is structured into two folders:
In-silico: for the first set of test where the frequencies to be predicted were created via R from mono-culutres &
In-vitro: for the second tests where the frequencies to be predicted were mixed from fixed cultures of different clonal lineages

Both folders contain Rmd scripts for creating the NN models and running it over the prepared frequencies in the corresponding folders.
All raw data of mono-cultures for configuring the NN moddels and frequency predictions are available as well.
